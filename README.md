## Introduction

Nexaflow's core is a powerful, event-driven traffic simulation engine designed for accurate mesoscopic traffic modeling. It supports multimodal transportation means and can handle large-scale traffic networks efficiently.

---

## Features

- **Event-based Simulation**: Precise traffic flow modeling using event-driven mechanics.
- **Multimodal Support**: Seamlessly integrates various transportation modes, including cars, buses, bicycles, and pedestrians.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently processes large-scale traffic networks without compromising on accuracy.
- **C++ Core**: Written in C++, the core simulation offers speed and flexibility for integration into various systems.
